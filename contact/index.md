#### Join the Exciting Journey at INSPIRE Lab!
At Imaging- and Neuro-computations for Precision Informatics Research (INSPIRE) Lab, we aim to uncover the intricacies of brain function, neurological disorders, and other biological processes by modeling and analyzing spatiotemporal dynamics. We leverage advanced data science techniques to interpret data from cutting-edge imaging technologies. By joining our team, you will contribute to groundbreaking discoveries in brain science, informatics, and beyond. We currently have multiple [openings](/team/#openings) for postdocs, graduate, and undergraduate students.

#### Why Choose Us?
The INSPIRE Lab, part of the Fischell Department of Bioengineering, is located in A. James Clark Hall at the University of Maryland, College Park. Our lab is adjacent to advanced neuroimaging core facilities and equipped with high-performance computing resources. Besides the exciting research and resources, UMD's proximity to major government research institutions such as NIH, NSF, DOD, and FDA, as well as leading hospitals, presents extensive collaboration opportunities. Additionally, the campus is conveniently situated near Washington D.C. and Baltimore, offering a variety of living and recreational options.
