## Lab members actions

Lab members, please do any/all of the following!

* **Update your user profile**. See the markdown files at https://github.com/inspirelab-site/inspirelab.site/tree/main/_members.  For info on the format, see the other examples there. There is also documentation at https://greene-lab.gitbook.io/lab-website-template-docs/basics/team-members. To create a new profile, just add a new `firstname-lastname.md` file to the `_members` directory. To update your info, just edit the `.md` file that already exists.  In either case, create a pull request or commit your changes directly.
    * Here is a blank template for a user profile; fill in as much info as you like:
