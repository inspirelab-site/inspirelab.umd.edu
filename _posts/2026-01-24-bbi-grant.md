Thank you to UMD's Brain & Behavior Institute for supporting our work with a seed grant. In collaboration with Dr. Nicolas Francis, the grant will fund our project on [Stimulus and State-Dependence of Brain Network Dynamics During Psilocybin Treatment in Mice](https://bbi.umd.edu/seed-grants/2026-projects).
