Hey :> I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science + Psychology @ UMD. I'm the personification of "curiosity killed the cat" (why I like psych) and a creative (why I like CS) who hopes to go to grad school for computer science if the <5% acceptance rates bless him the opportunity to do so. If I magically have free time on my hands, which normally isn't the case, I like doing stuff that revolves around video games, guitar, Youtube, baking, piano, cooking, reading, and art.
